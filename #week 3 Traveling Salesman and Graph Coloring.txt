Week 3 Code and Output

Code:

from sys import maxsize
from itertools import permutations

V = 4

def travellingSalesmanProblem(graph, s):
    vertex = [i for i in range(V) if i != s]
    min_path = maxsize
    for i in permutations(vertex):
        current_pathweight = 0
        k = s
        for j in i:
            current_pathweight += graph[k][j]
            k = j
        current_pathweight += graph[k][s]
        min_path = min(min_path, current_pathweight)
    return min_path

graph = [[0, 10, 15, 20], [10, 0, 35, 25], [15, 35, 0, 30], [20, 25, 30, 0]]
print(travellingSalesmanProblem(graph, 0))
        

Output:

80
