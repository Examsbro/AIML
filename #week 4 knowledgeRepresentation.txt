Week 4 Code and Output

Output:
rained = True, visited_hagrid = True, visited_dumbledore = True
Statement 1 (¬R → H) evaluates to: True
Statement 2 (H ⊕ D) evaluates to: False
Statement 3 (D) evaluates to: True
Combined formula evaluates to: False
rained = True, visited_hagrid = False, visited_dumbledore = True
Statement 1 (¬R → H) evaluates to: True
Statement 2 (H ⊕ D) evaluates to: True
Statement 3 (D) evaluates to: True
Combined formula evaluates to: True
rained = False, visited_hagrid = True, visited_dumbledore = True
Statement 1 (¬R → H) evaluates to: True
Statement 2 (H ⊕ D) evaluates to: False
Statement 3 (D) evaluates to: True
Combined formula evaluates to: False
rained = False, visited_hagrid = False, visited_dumbledore = True
Statement 1 (¬R → H) evaluates to: False
Statement 2 (H ⊕ D) evaluates to: True
Statement 3 (D) evaluates to: True
Combined formula evaluates to: False
Consistent scenarios based on combined formula:
rained = True, visited_hagrid = False, visited_dumbledore = True
In combined logical formula:
visited_dumbledore & (visited_dumbledore ^ visited_hagrid) & (Implies(~rained, visited_hagrid))
